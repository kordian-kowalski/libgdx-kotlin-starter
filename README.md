# A minimalistic LibGDX Kotlin starter

Minimalistic Gradle starter configuration for a LibGDX project using Kotlin and KTX.

## Development
**IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio**:
1. open the directory as a project
1. accept the prompt to import a Gradle project
1. if IDEA / Android Studio complains about Project JDK not being defined, just select your installed JDK from the dropdown instead of *project default*.

Alternatively you can choose to import a Gradle project directly which will achieve the same thing.

## Running the project
Run `gradlew run` in terminal in the project directory.

## Disclaimer
Yes, there are a lot of unconfigured options: Java, tests, IDEA / eclipse plugins, probably more.

This is only meant to be a barebones starter script for geting a LibGDX project going under Kotlin.

This also demonstrates how little configuration is needed to get a project like this to build and run with Gradle.
